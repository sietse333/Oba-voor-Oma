**Description of project**

This is a project i made for the Oba in Amsterdam. It uses the API from Oba to display different books or other sources of information from the Oba. People can type in searchcommands to see the literature they want or they can filter through it.

**User story**

As an older person i want to navigate the Oba website without any confusion. I also want to filter trough the different release dates of the books.

**How to instal**

You can simply fork this project and run it on your pc. You need to run it from a live server so if you have visual studio code you need to download the live server extension. 

**External data source?**

I am using the Oba api for the content. I got this api from my teachers because the Oba and the Hva work closely together for some years.

**Wishlist**
-I wanted to work more with returns instead of import/exporting everything. I didnt have enough time to fully grasp it and i left it for next project to learn. 
-I applied a map instead of a foreach one time but for my next project i want to master this. 
-I wanted to do some more things with the second api but i didnt have enough time in the end. 
-I didnt have enough time to add hashing and this is definitely something i want to learn so i can press a article to go to a sepperate page with the product or book.
-I got all the main functions i was planning to make done but i have no fun easter eggs :(
