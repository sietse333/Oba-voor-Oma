**Description of project**

This is a project i made for the Oba in Amsterdam. It uses the API from Oba to display different books or other sources of information from the Oba. People can type in searchcommands to see the literature they want or they can filter through it.

**User story**

As an older person i want to navigate the Oba website without any confusion. I also want to filter trough the different release dates of the books.




**How to instal**

You can simply fork this project and run it on your pc. You need to run it from a live server so if you have visual studio code you need to download the live server extension. 

**External data source?**

I am using the Oba api for the content. I got this api from my teachers because the Oba and the Hva work closely together for some years.
